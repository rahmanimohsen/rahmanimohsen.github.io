I am an engineer, teacher and researcher with 15+ years of experience in teaching computer science courses. As an associate professor and former department head, Iâ€™ve designed graduate courses in data science, statistical learning, and AI ethics, while supervising 50+ theses on AI-related and data science topics. I thrive on transforming complex concepts into accessible, project-driven learning experiences.

My research focuses on scalable AI systems, with algorithms deployed in commercial products. I have pulications in top-tier venues (IEEE, ACM, Elsevier). 

Beyond academia, I collaborate with industry partners to solve practical challenges.
